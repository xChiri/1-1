# 1-1
<p> 1+1 is an addictive puzzle game with a simple algorithm behind itself. 
At every step a new "1" circle will be randomly spawned in the centre of the table, on one of the 9 circles. 
You have to send it to a border by swiping the screen up or down, left or right. 
If the circle is still in the centre of the table after the swipe, the game is over. 
The circles on the border will also move in the direction which you indicated.
2 circles of same value will become one with the value of their addition. 
Creating circles with big values will increase your score. </p>
